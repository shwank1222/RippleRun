## 🌊 About the Game
RippleRun is a small experimental project created for **Game Off 2025**, developed over two weeks by two Unreal Engine client programming students.

The goal was to recreate the simple, calming pleasure of throwing a stone into the water and watching the ripples expand — focusing on physics, motion, sound, and atmosphere rather than complexity.

## ✨ Features
- Custom skipping stone physics (airborne, bouncing, gliding, sinking)
- Tilt-based curve control and Magnus-lift simulation
- Water surface detection and dynamic splash/ripple effects
- Niagara-driven VFX for splashes and expanding ripples
- Ambient water SFX for a relaxing feel
- Small, focused UE5 framework optimized for rapid iteration

## 🎮 Controls
- Left Mouse Button — Set the throw power and yaw spin based on your timing
- Move Mouse — Adjust the stone’s tilt (pitch & roll) before throwing

## 📦 Installation
